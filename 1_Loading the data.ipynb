AI powered trading coulf potentially reduce the risk and maximize returns. So the goal of the project is to leverage a model to predict the future stock prices. By accurately predicting stock prices, investors can maximize returns and can get an idea as to when they should buy or sell securities. The AI/ML model will be trained using a type of recurrent neural network(RNN)know as long short term memory networks(LSTM).Investment firms have adopted machine learning in recent years rapidly, even some firms have started replacing humans with A.I. to make investment decisions.In this project, 100 days stock closing values is used to predict the next day's stock price."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"NWFANuRf1drf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1618705058703,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":239,"user":{"displayName":"Jimisha Thakkar","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjJEO9h9hjhZCbHRTAJ5b4ZcSoc7C-EumUj_fcrKgs=s64","userId":"03459090157842007766"}},"outputId":"c13f1ba5-02b9-47c6-ee00-9fd68a413a12"},"source":["# Mount Google Drive\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zyTz6D-1sRuM"},"source":["### **1.
